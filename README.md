# jobnimbus-assessment
JobNimbus technical assessment for Automation Engineer

I started fooling around with the assessment long before I realized that I should probably put this up in GitHub, so the first commit is big. :) 

Anywho! You are probably already familiar with these steps, but I wanted to add them here for completeness:

* Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/triss27/jobnimbus-assessment.git`
* Navigate to cloned repo directory
* Install dependancies: `npm install`
* Run tests: `npm test`

Cheers!
